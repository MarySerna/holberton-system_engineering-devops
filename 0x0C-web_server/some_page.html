            <h1>History <img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3785/9052837509_bef07e5973_o.jpg"></h1>
            <p>Antioquia is one of the thirty-two departments that make up the Republic of Colombia. Its capital is
                Medellín, the second most populated city in the country. It is locat\ ed in the northwest of the
                country, in the Andean and Caribbean regions, bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea (Atlantic
                Ocean), Córdoba and Bolívar, on the east by Santander a\ nd Boyacá, on the south by Caldas and
                Risaralda, and on the west by Chocó. With about 6.5 million inhabitants. in 2015 it is the most
                populated department and with 63 600 km², the \ sixth largest, surpassed by Amazonas, Vichada, Caquetá,
                Meta and Guainía...</br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-OD3KaVHSE&t=25s">We love

            <h2>Geography <img src="https://colombiatours.travel/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/guatape_3_1.jpg"></h2>
            <p>The territory of the Department of Antioquia is characterized by a varied relief, represented, on the one
                hand, by flat areas that comprise two thirds of the total land,\ and which are located in the Magdalena
                Valley, in the sub-region known as Bajo Cauca, in the areas near the department of Chocó, and in the
                areas near the coastal region of Urabá;\ and on the other hand, the relief is conformed by an extensive
                very mountainous area that is part of the Central and Western Cordilleras of the Andes, which make up a
                third of Ant\ ioquia's soil, and in which 202 important highs stand out, with elevations that oscillate
                between 1,000 and 4,080 meters above sea level...</br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/wat\

            <h3>Food <img
                    src="http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media.elpasajero.metro.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/10055650/img_94842.jpg">
            </h3>
            <p>A very distinctive feature of the Antioquia region is its gastronomy. The main food base is corn. The
                arepa is the most important food product of corn, since it serves a\ s a complement for all meals. There
                are diverse arepas: arepa de chócolo, thin arepa, round arepa, arepa de monte or peeled corn, among
                others. The mazamorra is another food produc\ t of corn, like empanadas, which are of different kinds.
                The sancocho paisa is typical for lunch, the same as the dish of beans. However, the most representative
                dish is the Paisa tray, or mountaineer dish, which consists of wh\ ite rice, cargamanto beans (red),
                powdered meat, pork rinds, sausage or blood sausage, fried egg, avocado, ripe banana slices, patacón and
                arepa; It can also be accompanied with re\ d sliced hogao and tomato. As a dessert, it is customary to
                take the mazamorra of corn with panela tiruda or scraped, although the accompaniment has been extended
                to sodas or dri\ nks such as guarapo, which is sugarcane juice with lemon. At Christmas the custard, the
                fritters and the corn flakes are used. Other typical dishes are tamales and mondongo soup.</br><a

            <h4>Shopping<img src="https://d1ez3020z2uu9b.cloudfront.net/imagecache/blog-photos/268_Fill_800_800.jpg">
            </h4>
            <p>Paisas love to shop and Medellín and the Aburrá Valley has a huge number of centro comercials (shopping
                centers or malls). In this article we look at several of the largest mall\ s in the Medellín area to
                find out the 13 best malls in Medellín. In this article we look at 22 different shopping malls in
                Medellín and the Aburrá Valley and selected the 13 best \ malls in the Medellín metro area. Most of the
                malls we include in this article are Western-style malls that tend to have larger chain stores that are
                found in the largest malls in \ Medellín like Viva Envigado, Santafé and El Tesoro. Three of the malls
                we include in this article about the best malls only have small tiendas (shops): Monterrey, Palacio
                Nacional \ and Terracina Plaza. But Medellín has many more (seemingly countless) small centro comericals
                throughout the metro area that tend to only have small tiendas. But we couldn’t possib\ ly include all
                the small centro comericials in Medellín in this article, as there are just too many of them. However,
                we also looked at El Hueco, which is a shopping area in El Cen\ tro in Medellín with reportedly over 80
                small shopping centers and some of the cheapest prices in the city in thousands of small shops. I have
                seen other articles on the Internet \ about the best malls in Medellín but all of these miss some of the
                best and most popular malls in the Medellín metro area.</br><a
